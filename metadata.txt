about=This tool takes advantage of existing processing algorithms that come with QGIS to obtain and visualize elevation-area-storage relationship of a hypothetical dam/embankment on a water-course. It also automatically creates a polygon for the inundated area by the dam and extracts corresponding Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
